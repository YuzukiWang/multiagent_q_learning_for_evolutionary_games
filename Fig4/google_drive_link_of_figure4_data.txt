payoffMatrix.txt: The payoff matrix of of fifteen strategies.

WithoutMTBR_delta0.5_{index}.txt: The state evolution process obtained by one simulation (without MTBR). Each row represents the proportion of strategies at that time, and each column represents one strategy. The data is sampled every ten generations.
