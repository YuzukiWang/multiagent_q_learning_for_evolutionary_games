# multiagent_q_learning_for_evolutionary_games
This repository contains the source code for the paper "Exploring dominant strategies in iterated and evolutionary games: a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach". The code is designed to investigate dominant strategies in both iterated and evolutionary game settings, using multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques.
