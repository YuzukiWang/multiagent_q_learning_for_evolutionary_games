# multiagent_q_learning_for_evolutionary_games
This repository contains the source code for the paper "Exploring dominant strategies in iterated and evolutionary games: a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach". The code is designed to investigate dominant strategies in both iterated and evolutionary game settings, using multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques.

## Introduction

This repository provides the Multi-agent-Q-learning code for finding the dominant strategy in evolutionary games, i.e., the memory-two bilateral reciprocity (MTBR) strategy. It also includes the data for the figures presented in the paper and the code for generating those figures.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.85
- Basic Python libraries

## Usage

To run the code, simply execute the `.py` files located in the selected folder. There are no additional requirements or configurations necessary.
