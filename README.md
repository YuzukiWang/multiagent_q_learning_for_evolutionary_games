# multiagent_q_learning_for_evolutionary_games
This repository contains the source code for the paper "Exploring dominant strategies in iterated and evolutionary games: a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach". The code is designed to investigate dominant strategies in both iterated and evolutionary game settings, using multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques.

## Introduction

This project provides the implementation of the experiments discussed in the paper. The agents are trained using reinforcement learning in repeated and evolutionary games to observe strategy dynamics, focusing on dominant strategies in different game settings.
